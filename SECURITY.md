## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, **please do not create a public issue**.  
Instead, report it privately so we can address it quickly.

**How to report:**
- Email: [security@aherendeen.com](mailto:security@aherendeen.com)  
- Or use GitHub’s [private vulnerability reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) (if enabled for this repo)

**What to include:**
- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

**What to expect:**
- We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**
- We’ll provide a status update at least every **5 business days**
- Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we’ll work on a fix and coordinate a release before public disclosure
- If the vulnerability is declined, we’ll explain why

We greatly appreciate your efforts to improve the security of this project and will credit you for your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
